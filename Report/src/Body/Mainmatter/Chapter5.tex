\chapter{CONCLUSION}
In this project, some integer and stack based overflow conditions are handled. The integer overflows for expressions and bound limits for stack arrays are checked. As a result, the possible problems are list using a GUI. 

The program generally creates a syntax representation of the source code. After that, it performs value flow analysis to detect overflows. Currently, the syntax of the C language is very limited. After detecting the overflows, the errors are listed in the GUI.

In future study, the syntax analyser implemented in this project should be improved. The expression and statement models should cover all C Language syntax models. The diagnosis engine also modified according to syntax analyser.
