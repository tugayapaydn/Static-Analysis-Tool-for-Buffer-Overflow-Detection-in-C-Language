This study presents a static analysis tool for C language that can detect some buffer overflows that are generally called integer and stack overflows. Buffer overflows occur when a program tries to access to outside of an allocated memory area. In most cases, this causes the program to crash. In a worse scenario, a buffer overflow can provide the access an attacker needs to gain remote code execution. To provide secure code against buffer overflows, programmers need methods for analyzing source code of a program to detect buffer overflow vulnerabilities. One way to implement such a method is to perform static analysis on the program. This involves looking at the source code to find the errors in the program. This study uses syntax analysis and then value flow analysis to find overflows in a source code of a program.
